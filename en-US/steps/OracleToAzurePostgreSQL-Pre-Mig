<!--Pre-migration overview-->

As you prepare for migrating to the cloud, verify that your source environment is supported and that you have addressed any prerequisites. This will help to ensure an efficient and successful migration.

### Additional resources

- Be sure to check out the [Azure Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator](https://aka.ms/azure-tco) to help estimate the cost savings you can realize by migrating your workloads to Azure.
- For a matrix of the Microsoft and third-party services and tools that are available to assist you with various database and data migration scenarios as well as specialty tasks, see the article [Service and tools for data migration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/dms-tools-matrix).

<p>With Oracle, you can assign a non-scalar condition in the WHERE clause. However, SQL Server doesn&rsquo;t support this type of condition. As a result, SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;convert queries with a non-scalar condition in the WHERE clause, instead generating an error&nbsp;O2SS0001. This white paper provides more details on the issue and ways to resolve it.</p>
