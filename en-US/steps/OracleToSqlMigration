<!--Migrate schema and data-->

After you have completed assessing your databases and addressing any discrepancies, the next step is to execute the migration process. Migration involves two steps – publishing the schema and migrating the data. SSMA for Oracle is the correct tool to use for this process.

### Steps

To use SSMA for Oracle to publish the database schema and migrate the data, perform the following steps.

1. **Publish the schema to SQL Server**.

    a. After schema conversion, you can save the project locally for an offline schema remediation exercise. You can do so by selecting **Save Project** from the **File** menu. This gives you an opportunity to evaluate the source and target schemas offline and perform remediation before you can publish the schema to SQL Server.

    b. To publish the schema, select the database from the **Databases** node in the **SQL Server Metadata Explorer** and then selecting **Synchronize with Database** on the right-click menu.

    This action publishes the Oracle schema to the SQL Server instance.

2. **Migrate data to SQL Server**.

    a.	After publishing the schema to the SQL Server instance, select the Oracle schema from the **Oracle Metadata Explorer** and then selecting **Migrate Data** on the right-click menu.
  
    b.	Provide connection details for Oracle and SQL Server in their respective connection dialogs to migrate the data.

    c. After the migration is complete, you can view the **Data Migration report**.

    d. Validate the migration by using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to review the data and schema on the SQL Server instance.

**Important**: SSMA does not support migration of all Oracle features. For associated workarounds, see the following resource:

* [Migration approach for selected Oracle features](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/datamigration/2017/05/10/migration-approach-for-oracle-features/)

 In addition to using SSMA, you can also use SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to migrate the data.
