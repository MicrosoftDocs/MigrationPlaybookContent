<!--Migrate schema-->

After you are comfortable with the assessment and satisfied that the selected database is a viable candidate for migration to Azure SQL Database, use the Data Migration Assistant to migrate the schema to Azure SQL Database.

**Note**: Before you create a migration project in Data Migration Assistant, be sure that you have already provisioned an Azure SQL database as mentioned in the prerequisites.

### Steps

To use DMA to create a migration project, perform the following steps.

1.	In the Data Migration Assistant, select the New (+) icon, and then under **Project type**, select **Migration**.
2.	Specify a project name, in the **Source server type** text box, select **SQL Server**, and then in the **Target server type** text box, select **Azure SQL Database**.
3.	Under **Migration Scope**, select **Schema only**.

    After performing the previous steps, the Data Migration Assistant interface should appear as shown in the following graphic:
