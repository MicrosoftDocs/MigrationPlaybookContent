<!--Data sync-->

You can migrate your existing DB2 database to Azure SQL Datatabase by using Attunity Replicate for Microsoft Migrations, a co-sponsored, joint offering from Attunity and Microsoft that is provided to Microsoft customers free of charge. Attunity Replicate for Microsoft Migrations also enables minimum downtime in database migration, and the source database continues to be operational during the migration process.

Attunity Replicate is a data replication tool that enables data sync between a variety of sources and targets, propagating the schema creation script and data associated with each database table. Attunity Replicate will not propagate any other artifacts (such as SP, triggers, functions, etc.) or convert, for example, PL/SQL code hosted in such artifacts, to T-SQL.

**Note**: While Attunity Replicate supports a broad set of migration scenarios, Attunity Replicate for Microsoft Migrations is focused on support for a specific a subset of source/target pairs.

An overview of the process for performing a migration includes:
1.	**Converting the source DB2 database** (schema and data) to a database in Azure SQL Database by using tools such as the [SQL Server Migration Assistant](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54258), the [Azure Database Migration Service](http://sqldatabase-migrationpreview.azurewebsites.net/), or any other third-party tool.
2.	**Continuously replicating data changes from the source database to the target database** by using Attunity Replicate for Microsoft Migrations. This will minimize the time that the source database will need to be set to read-only while you prepare to switch your applications to the target SQL Server database.
