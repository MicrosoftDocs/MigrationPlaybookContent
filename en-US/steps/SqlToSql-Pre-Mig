<!--Pre-migration overview-->

As you prepare for upgrading your SQL Server database to a later version of SQL Server, consider the versions of SQL Server that are supported and to address any prerequisites. This will help to ensure an efficient and successful migration.

### Supported upgrade technologies

This section describes all supported scenarios and options for an upgrade from and older version of SQL Server to a newer version of SQL Server, current as of March 2019.

Supported source and target versions are shown in the following table.

<p>This guide offers optimization advice for executing point-lookups against SQL Server from .NET as efficiently as possible. Customers wishing to migrate from mainframe databases to SQL Server may desire to migrate existing mainframe-optimized design patterns, especially when using 3rd party tools (such as Raincode Compiler) to automatically migrate mainframe code (COBOL/JCL etc) to T-SQL and C# .NET.</p>

### Prerequisites

Before beginning your migration project, it is important to address the associated prerequisites. To prepare for the migration, download and install the:

* Latest version of the [MAP Toolkit](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=316883).
* [Data Migration Assistant](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53595) v3.3 or later.
* Latest version of the [Database Experimentation Assistant](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54090).
