### Prerequisites

* Create a VNET for the Azure Database Migration Service by using the Azure Resource Manager deployment model, which provides site-to-site connectivity to your on-premises source servers by using either [ExpressRoute](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction) or [VPN](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways). You can learn more in the article [Network topologies for Azure SQL DB Managed Instance migrations using the Azure Database Migration Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dms/resource-network-topologies).
* Ensure that your Azure Virtual Network (VNET) Network Security Group rules do not block the following communication ports 443, 53, 9354, 445, 12000. For more detail on Azure VNET NSG traffic filtering, see the article [Filter network traffic with network security groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-nsg).
* Configure your Windows Firewall for source database engine access. For more information, see the article [Configure a Windows Firewall for Database Engine Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/configure-a-windows-firewall-for-database-engine-access).
* Open your Windows Firewall to allow the Azure Database Migration Service to access the source SQL Server, which by default is TCP port 1433.
* If you are running multiple named SQL Server instances using dynamic ports, you may wish to enable the SQL Browser Service and allow access to UDP port 1434 through your firewalls so that the Azure Database Migration Service can connect to a named instance on your source server.
* If you are using a firewall appliance in front of your source databases, you may need to add firewall rules to allow the Azure Database Migration Service to access the source database(s) for migration, as well as files via SMB port 445.
* Create an Azure SQL Database Managed Instance by following the detail in the article [Create an Azure SQL Database Managed Instance in the Azure portal](https://aka.ms/sqldbmi).
* Ensure that the logins used to connect the source SQL Server and target Managed Instance are members of the sysadmin server role.
* Create a network share that the Azure Database Migration Service can use to back up the source database.
* Ensure that the service account running the source SQL Server instance has write privileges on the network share that you created and that the computer account for the source server has read/write access to the same share.
* Make a note of a Windows user (and password) that has full control privilege on the network share that you previously created. The Azure Database Migration Service impersonates the user credential to upload the backup files to Azure storage container for restore operation.
* Create a blob container and retrieve its SAS URI by using the steps in the article [Manage Azure Blob Storage resources with Storage Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-explorer-blobs#get-the-sas-for-a-blob-container), and be sure to select all permissions (Read, Write, Delete, List) on the policy window while creating the SAS URI. This detail provides the Azure Database Migration Service with access to your storage account container for uploading the backup files used for migrating databases to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance.
