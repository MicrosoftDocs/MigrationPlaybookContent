<!--Migrate schema and data-->

After you have completed assessing your databases and addressing any discrepancies, the next step is to execute the migration process. Migration involves two steps – publishing the schema and migrating the data. SSMA for DB2 is the correct tool to use for this process.

### Steps

To use SSMA for DB2 to publish the database schema and migrate the data, perform the following steps.

1. **Publish the schema to Azure SQL Database**.

    a. After schema conversion you can save this project locally for an offline schema remediation exercise. You can do so by choosing "Save Project" from the "File" menu. This gives you an opportunity to evaluate the source and target schemas offline and perform remediation before you can publish the schema to Azure SQL Database.

    b. To Publish the schema, select the database from the "Databases" node in the "SQL Azure Metadata Explorer" and choose "Synchronize with Database" from the right-click menu options

    c. This action will publish the DB2 schema to the Azure SQL Database instance.

2. **Migrate data to Azure SQL Database **.

    a.	After publishing the schema to the Azure SQL Database instance, select the DB2 schema from the "DB2 Metadata Explorer” and choose "Migrate Data" from the right-click menu options or the menu bar on the top.
  
    b.	At this step you will be required to provide connection details for DB2 and Azure SQL Database in their respective connection dialogs to migrate the data.

    c. After the migration is complete you will be able to view the "Data Migration report".

    d. Validate the migration by reviewing the data and schema on the Azure SQL instance by using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
