## Migration process overview

Migrations should be approached with the same rigor and processes as a full software or hardware project – a  solid methodology is required for success. When planning a migration project, we recommend that you consider the process shown in the following graphic:

Each phase in the database migration process is briefly described in the following table:

<table id="overview" class="overview">

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><strong>Stage</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Phase</strong></th>

      <td>Discover</td>
      <td>Inventory database assets, and application stack discovery.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Assess</td>
      <td>Assess workloads and fix recommendations.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Convert</td>
      <td>Convert the source schema to work in the target environment. This is only relevant for heterogeneous migrations.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="3" class="migration">Migration</td>
      <td>Migrate schema, data, and objects</td>
      <td>Migrate the source schema, and then migrate the source data to the target.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sync data</td>
      <td>Sync your target schema and data with the source. This is only relevant for minimal-downtime migrations.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cutover</td>
      <td>Cut over from the source to the target environment. This is only relevant for minimal-downtime migrations.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="3" class="postmigration">Post-migration</td>
      <td>Remediate applications</td>
      <td>Iteratively make any necessary changes to your applications.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Perform Tests</td>
      <td>Iteratively run functional and performance tests.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Optimize</td>
      <td>Based on the tests you performed, address any performance issues, and then retest to confirm the performance improvements.</td>
    </tr>
