<!--Migrate using Attunity Replicate for Microsoft Migrations-->

### Near zero downtime migrations with Attunity Replicate!

Microsoft has partnered with Attunity around specific migration scenarios (source/target pairs). Attunity Replicate supports a very large set of sources and targets. The edition of Attunity Replicate that we refer to in the context of this partnership is known as Attunity Replicate For Microsoft Migrations (this is an Attunity product and not a Microsoft product) and enables only the scenarios for which we are partnering for now. 

Attunity Replicate is a data replication tool that enables data sync between a variety of sources and targets. In this context, 
for each table, Attunity Replicate propagates its schema creation script and its data. It will not propagate any other artifacts (SP, triggers, functions, ….) 
and will not convert say PL/SQL code hosted in artifacts like functions/SP/triggers to T-SQL. 

Proposed sequence and usage of tools:
1.	**Convert the source MySQL database** (schema and data) to Azure MySQL.
2.	**Continuously replicate data changes from the source database to the target database** with _Attunity Replicate For Microsoft Migrations_. This will help you minimize the amount of time you will need to prevent writes on the source database while you prepare to switch your applications to the target MySQL on Aure.

**Important**: Using Attunity Replicate for Microsoft Migrations to pump data out of a database hosted on Rackspace (IaaS) is supported if the version of the source endpoint and the target are among those that are supported by Attunity Replicate.

### Setting up Attunity for MySQL Replication

1.	Setup a Windows Virtual Machine in Azure with the minimum of 4 vCPUs, 28GB of RAM. DS12_V2 Standard SKU from Azure Windows Server 2016 should work. Setup the VM in the same region as the target Azure MySQL. Attunity works on Linux as well.

2.	Download [Attunity](http://discover.attunity.com/download-replicate-microsoft-lp6657.html). Make sure to select at least one Database Migration Scenario and at least one Data Warehouse Migration Scenarios.

3.	Install Attunity through its install wizard

4.	After setup, you should see Attunity Replicate Server and Attunity Replicate UI Server running in Windows Services.

5.	Download [MySQL ODBC Connection]( https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/odbc/) and install on this VM.

### Setting up the Source

1.	For MySQL, Attunity is using import/export technology for initial load. It will export the data into .csv files and using SQL query to insert data into the target MySQL Server. Any changes happens in the source while the initial load is happening, Attunity uses MySQL binlog to identify the changes and replay the changes to target server (i.e. replication).

2.	Enable binlog=row in AWS RDS using **parameter group** in RDS Dashboard.

3.	Reboot MySQL to take effect.

### Setting up Attunity Replication task

1.	Use Attunity UI to setup replication (i.e. migration). Go to https://localhost/attunityreplicate, it should bring you to the homepage.

2.	Select New Task, give it a name, choose the settings as shown below
   ![New Task Creation](https://mpbdevcontent.azureedge.net/Images/attunitynewtask.png)
 
3.	Select Manage Endpoint Connections on the top menu bar
   ![Manage endpoints](https://mpbdevcontent.azureedge.net/Images/attunitymanageendpoint.png)
 
4.	Select + New Endpoint Connection on the top menu bar
   ![New connection endpoints](https://mpbdevcontent.azureedge.net/Images/attunitynewendpoint.png)
 
5.	Setup the Source endpoint. Name the endpoint. This should be the source MySQL Server. Select Type= MySQL

6.	Enter Server name, Port=3306, User name and Password. Remember to test connection to make sure connectivity is established. Save this endpoint.
   ![New connection endpoints parameters](https://mpbdevcontent.azureedge.net/Images/attunityendpointparam.png)
 
7.	Setup Targets- select + New Endpoint Connection again. Name the source endpoint. Select Target, and select Type=MySQL. This should the Azure Database for MySQL server that you have configured in Azure.

8.	Enter Server name, port:3306, user name and password. Browse to the database to the database that you want the data to migrate to. **Note:** Attunity will not create the database for you in Azure MySQL. You have to create one. Remember to test connection to make sure connectivity is established. Save this endpoint.

11. Navigate to Table Selection on the right hand panel.
   ![Table selection](https://mpbdevcontent.azureedge.net/Images/attunitymysqltableselection.png)
 
12. Select the table schema, which is the database you want to replicate. Click Include, it will show you the table list:
   ![Table list](https://mpbdevcontent.azureedge.net/Images/attunitytablelist.png)
 
13. Select tables that you want to replicate using the arrow button.

14. Press OK, Save the task.

15. At this point, all the information needed is setup in the task.

16. You can start to Run, or setup a time to Run the task.
