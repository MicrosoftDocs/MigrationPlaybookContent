<!-- Assess and Convert -->

### Steps

To use SSMA for MySQL to create an assessment, perform the following steps.

1. **Download [SSMA for MySQL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=54257)**, and then install it.

2. **Assess the source database** and discover conversion rate and effort to resolve issues.

   a.	Click on the "File" menu and choose "New Project". Provide the project name, a location to save your project and the migration target.

   b.   Select SQL Azure from the “Migrate To” options
    
   c. Click "OK".

   d. Connect to the MySQL server by providing the connection details in the "Connect to MySQL" dialog.

   e. Create the conversion report by selecting the MySQL schema in the "MySQL Metadata Explorer" by choosing "Create Report" from the right-click menu options or the menu bar on the top.

   f.	This will generate an HTML report with conversion statistics and error/ warnings, if any. Analyze this report to understand conversion issues and its cause.

   g.	This report can also be accessed from the SSMA projects folder as selected in the first screen. From the example above locate the report.xml file 
   from:
   
   *drive:*\Users\<username>\Documents\SSMAProjects\MySQLMigration\report\report_2016_11_12T02_47_55\
   
   and open it in Excel to get an inventory of MySQL objects and the effort required to perform schema conversions.
   
3. **Perform schema conversion**.

   a. Before you perform schema conversion validate the default datatype mappings or change them based on requirements. You could do so either by navigating to the "Tools" menu and choosing "Project Settings" or you can change type mapping for each table by selecting the table in the "MySQL Metadata Explorer".

   b.	Dynamic or ad hoc queries can be added to the "Statements" node by selecting that node and choosing "Add Statement" from the right-click menu options.
   
   c.	For converting and moving the schema to Azure SQL Database, connect to the Azure SQL instance by providing the connection details in the "Connect to Azure SQL Database" dialog. You can choose to connect to an existing database or provide a new name, in which case a database will be created on the target server.

   e.	After the schema has converted compare and review the structure of the schema to identify potential problems.
