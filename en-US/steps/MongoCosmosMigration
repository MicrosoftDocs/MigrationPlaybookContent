<!--Migrating from MongoDB-->

There are three options available to lift and shift your MongoDB to Azure Cosmos DB.

**Option #1: Import data to the API for MongoDB by using mongoimport** 

This is a utility supplied as part of MongoDB distribution that is able to import data from JSON or CSV files to the MongoDB. To import data 
to you Azure Cosmos DB account, use the template referenced in the [Import data to the API for MongoDB by using mongoimport](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb-migrate#import-data-to-the-api-for-mongodb-by-using-mongoimport) section of the article Azure Cosmos DB: Import MongoDB data.

**Option #2: Import data to the API for MongoDB by using mongorestore** 

This is also part of MongoDB distribution and is used to restore MongoDB dump files (snapshots) into MongoDB. Use the the template referenced in the [Import data to the API for MongoDB by using mongoimport](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb-migrate#import-data-to-the-api-for-mongodb-by-using-mongorestore) section of the article Azure Cosmos DB: Import MongoDB data to execute the import.

**Option #3: Azure Cosmos DB Data Migration Tool**

The other option is the Azure Cosmos DB [Data Migration tool](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46436), which is an open source solution that imports data to Azure Cosmos DB from a variety of sources, including: MongoDB, JSON files, SQL Server, etc.
