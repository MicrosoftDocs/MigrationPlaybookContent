<!--Using ora2pg to migrate from Oracle to Azure Database for PostgreSQL-->

PostgreSQL is one of world’s most advanced open source databases. This article describes how to use the free ora2pg utility to migrate an Oracle database to PostgreSQL.

**Important**: To participate in a private preview of Azure Database Migration Service support for performing online migrations of Oracle to Azure Database for PostgreSQL, express your interest by submitting a nomination via the [Azure DMS preview site](https://aka.ms/dms-preview).

You can use ora2pg, a free tool, to migrate an Oracle or MySQL database to a PostgreSQL compatible schema. The utility connects your Oracle database, scans it automatically, and extracts its structure or data. Afterwards ora2pg generates SQL scripts that you can load into your PostgreSQL database.

ora2pg can be used for tasks from reverse engineering an Oracle database, performing a huge enterprise database migration, or simply replicating some Oracle data into a PostgreSQL database. It’s easy to use and doesn't require any Oracle database knowledge other than the ability to provide the parameters needed to connect to the Oracle database.

**Note**: For more information about using the latest version of ora2pg, see the [ora2pg documentation](https://ora2pg.darold.net/documentation.html).

### Prerequisites
1. Before installing ora2pg, be sure to install the corresponding Oracle and PostgreSQL drivers.

2. Download the latest version of the [ora2pg tool](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ora2pg/), and then install it.

### Preparing for migration
After completing the prerequisites, the first step to prepare for the migration is to configure the ora2pg.conf file, which is located at /etc/ora2pg/ora2pg.conf.

Below are a few of the configuration parameters related to using Oracle as source. For this example, assume that we are exporting only the HR Schema.

    ORACLE_DSN  dbi:Oracle:host=hostname;sid=DB_SID;port=1521
    ORACLE_USER system
    ORACLE_PWD  xxxxx
    SCHEMA      HR
    TYPE        TABLE VIEW
    TYPE        TABLE PACKAGE COPY VIEW GRANT SEQUENCE TRIGGER FUNCTION PROCEDURE TABLESPACE TYPE PARTITION
    OUTPUT      hr_schema.sql
    
### Testing the connection
After setting the Oracle database DSN, you can execute ora2pg to see if it works by using the following command:

    ora2pg -t SHOW_VERSION -c config/ora2pg.conf

   
ora2pg works by exporting to an output file that the utility uses to convert the schema and generate the insert statements for the data. The data is then imported to the target DB. With ora2pg, if you use the SCHEMA option, the utility will allow only one schema at a time. To use ora2pg to export all schemas, simple comment out the SCHEMA option. In our example, all non-Oracle users will be extracted.

### Migrating to Azure Database for PostgreSQL

After the export is done, to import it to the target database, use the following command:

    Psql -h hostname -p 5432 -d databasename -U  username -W  -f ora2pg_output_filename

### Troubleshooting tips

If the **output.sql** file only includes the Pg transaction header and footer there are two possible reasons. If the Perl script ora2pg dumps an ORA-XXX error, then the DSN or log in information is wrong. Check the error and your settings, and then try again. If the Perl script doesn’t indicate any error and the output file is empty, then the user lacks the rights to extract data from the database. Try to connect to the Oracle database as super user or view the directive USER_GRANTS above and at next section, especially the SCHEMA directive.
