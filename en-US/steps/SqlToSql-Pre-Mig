<!--Pre-migration overview-->

As you prepare for upgrading your SQL Server database to a later version of SQL Server, be sure to consider the versions of SQL Server that are supported and to address any prerequisites to help ensure a successful migration.

### Supported upgrade technologies

This section describes all supported scenarios and options for an upgrade from and older version of SQL Server to a newer version of SQL Server, current as of December 2017.

The following SQL Server sources are included:
* SQL Server 2005

The following data migration options are discussed:
*	Backup and restore
*	Transactional replication
*	Always On availability groups
*	Data Migration toolset [Azure Database Migration Service (Azure DMS) and Data Migration Assistant (DMA)]

### Prerequisites

Before beginning your migration project, it is important to address the associated prerequisites.

* Download and install the latest version of the [MAP Toolkit](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=316883).
* Download and install the latest version of the [Database Experimentation Assistant](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54090).
* Download and install the [Data Migration Assistant](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53595) v3.3 or later.
* Create an instance of SQL Server on Azure VMs by following the detail in the article [How to provision a Windows SQL Server virtual machine in the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sql/virtual-machines-windows-portal-sql-server-provision).
